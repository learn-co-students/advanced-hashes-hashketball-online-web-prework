In this case, for this method, we don't need to deal with or iterate                                           over that data, so we can just skip past and deal directly with the attribute :players which is where the party (relevant data) is                                          for this method.

#def team_colors(team_name)

#  game_hash.each do |location, team_data|

#   if team_data == team_name                 This line was so wrong, because the conditional is asking if the team name passed in, which will be a string, is equal to the whole                                               team_data hash.

#    if team_data[:team_name] == team_name  # This is correct. First grabbing the value of team_data[:team_name], which is a string, and then asking if it is equal to team_name                                                passed in, which is also a string. This line is the correct reasoning for the conditional.
#binding.pry

#       team_data.each do |attribute, data|   These lines are not necessary because we don't need to iterate this deep to access the value of :colors. The first level iteration             if attribute == :colors            gives us access to the information we need and we used binding pry on line 111 to to plug in - team-data and :team_name and :colors to                                             see what was returned - verifying that we don't need to iterate further down into game_hash.

#binding.pry                                  # Very important take away: My initial approach to finding the player with the highest shoe size by comparing players shoe sizes, by defining placeholder values to zero and resetting those values when they are not zero when using them to compare shoe size values of each player and then re_assigning them when encountering a value that is higher, was Good! - reaching back to the previous problem solving in my key_for_min lab (see lines 234-244 below. Also note that the placeholder values are defined on lines 203-205 so they are accessible outside of the .each iterations scope.The placeholder values defined on lines 203-205 will be reset/re-asigned inside the iteration scope, but accessible from outside that scope because the are define outside that scop. So thay are accessible from within the scope and outside of it as well. Also and very important: The placeholder values are re_assigned (finalized) on lines 217-219 after all :players and their corresponding stats hash have been iterated through - after the final iteration, leaving me with the final players and that players data. The referrences - stats[:shoe], data_item, and stats[:rebounds] are all referrencing the data of the player of that iteration and are accessible as such. To return the player with the highest shoe size number of rebounds, is not about using some varient of bracket notation in the return statement (return highest_shoe_key[:rebounds] which is incorrect) to access that data (like I spent so much time fixated on) but... assigning the players stats[:rebounds] to a placeholder(variable) on line 219 (understanding that the stats[:rebounds] bracket notaion is correct and relevant to or corresponds to the last player of the final iteration) and just returning that placeholder(variable). This very long explanation may not be a very well articulated psuedo code, but hopefully serve to explain all my progressive reasoning in problem solving this method for future referrnce.
